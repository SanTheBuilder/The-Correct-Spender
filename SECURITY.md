# Security Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Financial Planning Application to protect user data and ensure secure operations.

## Authentication
- **Provider**: Supabase Auth
- **Features**: Email/password authentication, email verification, guest mode
- **Security**: Secure session management, automatic token refresh

## Row-Level Security (RLS) Policies

### Profiles Table
- **SELECT**: Users can view their own profile
- **INSERT**: Users can create their own profile  
- **UPDATE**: Users can update their own profile
- **DELETE**: Users can delete their own profile ✅ (Added in security fix)

### Financial Assessments Table
- **SELECT**: Users can view their own assessments
- **INSERT**: Users can create their own assessments
- **UPDATE**: Users can update their own assessments
- **DELETE**: Users can delete their own assessments ✅ (Confirmed existing)

### Budgets Table
- **SELECT**: Users can view their own budgets
- **INSERT**: Users can create their own budgets
- **UPDATE**: Users can update their own budgets
- **DELETE**: Users can delete their own budgets (Implicit via user_id)

## Data Protection Measures

### 1. Input Validation
- Form validation using React Hook Form with Zod schemas
- Server-side validation through Supabase constraints
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries

### 2. Error Handling
- Centralized error handling with `errorHandler` utility
- Sanitized error messages to prevent information leakage
- Development-only detailed logging with `logger` utility

### 3. Logging Security
- Production logs exclude sensitive data
- Development logs include detailed debugging information
- All logs use structured format for security monitoring

### 4. Session Management
- Automatic session refresh
- Secure logout functionality
- Session validation on protected routes

## Security Validation

### Automated Testing
Use the security validation utilities:

```typescript
import { validateRLSPolicies, testUserDataAccess } from '@/utils/securityValidation';

// Validate all RLS policies
const rlsResult = await validateRLSPolicies();

// Test user data access restrictions
const accessResult = await testUserDataAccess();
```

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Always enable RLS** on new tables containing user data
2. **Test policies thoroughly** before deploying
3. **Use the logger utility** instead of console.log
4. **Validate all user inputs** both client and server-side
5. **Review error messages** to ensure no sensitive data leakage

### For Database Changes
1. Create RLS policies for all CRUD operations
2. Use `auth.uid()` to restrict access to user's own data
3. Test policies with different user scenarios
4. Document any new security implications

## Compliance
- **GDPR**: Users can delete their own data through DELETE policies
- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary user data is collected
- **Access Control**: Strict user-based data access restrictions

## Security Contacts
For security concerns or vulnerabilities, please follow responsible disclosure practices.
